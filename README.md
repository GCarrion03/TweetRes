## Description

athering information about what is being tweeted is used by many researchers to understand the population and what they think/feel on particular topics. However it is often the case that Twitter use can reveal the location/identity of individuals directly. This project will explore this topic directly and develop automated systems that explore the use of Twitter across the residences/homes of Melbourne. It will support data analytics and sentiment analysis and identify the happiest/saddest household; the happiest/saddest street as well as identify the household that uses most social media. This work will not divulge information on the individuals themselves, but instead show how such scenarios are now directly possible.
